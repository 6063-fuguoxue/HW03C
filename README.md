# HW03C Notes

For this homework, I assumed that all the dots are connected by pairs. Therefore, the workflow is as follows: 
<ol>
  <li>First, I randomly generate dots in the range of the canvas size. The number of dots is stored in a variable of integer type. I create an object called "dot," which contains the position information of a dot. Then, I store all the "dot" objects in an array called "dots."</li>
  <li>Second, I sequentially go through half of the dots and connect each of them to one of the other half of the dots in pairs. This is done by a for loop. </li>
</ol>

Below are the outcomes of 50-dot connections and 200-dot connections.
